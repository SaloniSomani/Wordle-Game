ABOUT THE GAME
The game Wordle is based on the well-known principle of a word search, but with an added 
twist: you need to find words related to a given keyword in the grid. The wordle game is a fun 
way to learn and practice new words. It is a handy tool to improve your vocabulary before any 
examination or test and improve your speaking skills.

HOW TO PLAY GAME
The interface consists of a 5×6 grid and a virtual keyboard. Navigate it using the mouse 
normally. Begin by typing in any term that would fit. For example, start with RESIN. Press Enter 
and examine the outcome. Gray tiles indicate that the characters they contain are not part of the 
solution. Yellows mean that their symbols are indeed present but should be in a different spot. 
Finally, greens signify that both the letter and the placement are correct. Continue going through 
various options and methodically deducing the answer.

RULES OF GAME
It consists of 6 five-cell rows where the submissions go. Below, there is a virtual keyboard. The 
goal is to give the correct answer in six tries or less. Sounds simple enough. However, a closer 
inspection reveals the true addicting nature of the process. Here’s the gist of it:
• The solution is identical for every participant
• Each submission must be a valid term that actually exists
• If it’s incorrect, the program lays out color-coded feedback
• Green boxes indicate that the letter is in its rightful spot
• Yellows mean that it is misplaced
• Grays imply that the symbol is not present at all
The challenger is supposed to use this information to narrow down the pool of options. That can 
be tricky to achieve but always very engaging
